            <h1><u>About Me</u></h1>
            <p>
                Hi, I am Saksham, a third-year student at <i>UC San Diego</i> majoring in
                Mathematics-CS with a double minor in Cognitive Science and Innovation and Entrepreneurship. I am
                passionate about
                technology, mostly leveraging web-dev technologies to build cool and helpful things. Fun-fact, I
                recently attended the SDx-AI
                hackathon held at the Design and Innocation building at UCSD!
            </p>
            <p>
                I aim to achieve proficiency in the space of web development, so I am able to deliver high-performance
                scalable web applications and websites for exceptional user experience. Here is my skill breakdown:

            <h1><u>Interests and Hobbies</u></h1>
            <p>
                When I am not studing or <code>coding</code>, you can mostly find me working out at the <em><b>24HR
                        Fitness Center.</b></em>
                In addition to this, I enjoy <i><b>intercollegiete debate</b></i>. Interestingly, I was a part of the
                UCSD Speech and Debate team for over a year! I also like
                <i><b>going on drives, playing football </b></i>(yes, I call it football not soccer) and <i><em>going
                        out with my girlfriend</em></i>. I also like <i><b>MMA and boxing</b></i> and I have heard
                San Digeo has a lot of retro-style boxing gyms. I would appreciate any suggestions!

                A very obscure hobby of mine is going for <i><b>ghost hunting</b></i>. There are a lot of paranormal
                places in SD such as the Whaley House and the Winchestor Museum.
